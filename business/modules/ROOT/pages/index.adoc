= Getting Started

The best way to get started working with us at here at littleman.co is to email the support mail:

- mailto:support@littleman.co?subject=Request%20for%20further%20information[support@littleman.co]

From there we can discuss whether we can help. Try and be as detailed as you can; to preserve our concentration and try
and be as efficient as possible we generally only check email 1x per 24 hour period.

== What is littleman.co

littleman.co is simply a corporate front for me (Andrew Howden) to push professional consultation through.

I like to try and be as helpful as possible but short of answering limited questions via Twitter (@andrewhowdencom)
or other as-needed services we need to come to a paid arrangement to ensure that I can continue to help you and others
like you while maintaining a reasonable lifestyle for myself.
